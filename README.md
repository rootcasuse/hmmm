# SafeHarbor - Secure Web-Based Communication Platform

A comprehensive secure messaging application with PKI-based digital signatures, end-to-end encryption, and document signing capabilities.

## 🔒 Security Features

### Core Security Architecture
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages are encrypted using AES-GCM with 256-bit keys
- **Digital Signatures**: ECDSA P-256 signatures for message authentication
- **Forward Secrecy**: HKDF-based key derivation for ephemeral message keys
- **PKI Integration**: Self-signed certificate authority for identity management
- **Session-Based Security**: Temporary certificates that expire with the session

### Cryptographic Primitives
- **Encryption**: AES-GCM-256 for symmetric encryption
- **Key Exchange**: ECDH P-256 for key agreement
- **Digital Signatures**: ECDSA P-256 for authentication
- **Hashing**: SHA-256 for integrity verification
- **Key Derivation**: HKDF-SHA256 for forward secrecy
- **Document Signing**: HMAC-SHA256 for simple file signatures

## 🏗️ Technical Stack

### Frontend Technologies
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Browser APIs & Standards
- **Web Crypto API**: All cryptographic operations
- **MediaDevices API**: Audio recording functionality
- **Permissions API**: Microphone access management
- **BroadcastChannel API**: Cross-tab communication
- **FileReader API**: File processing and data URLs
- **LocalStorage**: Session data persistence

### Cryptographic Libraries

## 🔐 Cryptographic Implementation Details

### Message Encryption Flow
1. **Key Generation**: ECDH P-256 key pairs generated per session
2. **Shared Secret**: ECDH key agreement between participants
3. **Message Keys**: HKDF derives unique keys per message
4. **Encryption**: AES-GCM with 96-bit IV and authentication tag
5. **Signature**: ECDSA signature over encrypted payload

### Digital Certificate System
- **Certificate Authority**: Self-signed root CA per session
- **User Certificates**: Issued with ECDSA P-256 public keys
- **Validity**: Certificates expire when session ends
- **Verification**: Full certificate chain validation

### Document Signing Process
- **Simple Mode**: HMAC-SHA256 with session keys
- **PKI Mode**: ECDSA signatures with certificate attachment
- **File Integrity**: SHA-256 hash of complete file content
- **Metadata**: Timestamp, filename, and size included in signature

## 🎯 Key Features

## 🔧 Security Best Practices Implemented

### Key Management
- **Ephemeral Keys**: All keys are session-based and non-persistent
- **Secure Generation**: Web Crypto API ensures cryptographically secure randomness
- **Memory Cleanup**: Explicit key material wiping on session end
- **No Key Reuse**: Fresh keys generated for each message

### Data Protection
- **No Persistent Storage**: Messages deleted when session ends
- **Secure Transport**: All data encrypted before transmission
- **Integrity Verification**: HMAC/ECDSA prevents tampering
- **Forward Secrecy**: Compromised keys don't affect past messages

### Browser Security
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers prevent XSS
- **CORS Headers**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing
- **Secure Contexts**: HTTPS required for crypto operations
- **Permission Management**: Explicit user consent for device access

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Build Optimizations
- **Code Splitting**: Vendor, crypto, and UI chunks separated
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code eliminated from bundles
- **Minification**: ESBuild for fast, optimized builds
- **Caching**: Immutable assets with long-term caching

### Runtime Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- **Memory Management**: Explicit cleanup of crypto materials
- **Efficient Rendering**: React hooks for optimal re-renders
- **Background Processing**: Web Workers for heavy crypto operations

## 🔍 Security Considerations

### Threat Model
- **Passive Eavesdropping**: Protected by end-to-end encryption
- **Active MITM**: Prevented by certificate verification
- **Message Tampering**: Detected by digital signatures
- **Replay Attacks**: Mitigated by timestamps and nonces

### Known Limitations
- **Trust on First Use**: No pre-shared certificate validation
- **Session-Based CA**: Certificate authority is temporary
- **Browser Dependency**: Security relies on Web Crypto API implementation
- **No Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Simple document signing uses symmetric keys
